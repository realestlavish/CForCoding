# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Practice

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice code.  
I created this repo to **build strong fundamentals**, improve **problem-solving skills**, and prepare for **coding interviews**.

The solutions are written mainly in **C++** and focus on **clarity, correctness, and efficiency**.
